It seems like you've already created the `.bat` file and placed it in the Startup folder, which is almost there! However, just placing the `.bat` file directly in the Startup folder won't automatically execute it on startup â€” you need to create a **shortcut** to that `.bat` file inside the Startup folder.

Here's what you need to do next to make it work:

### Steps to Add the `.bat` File as a Shortcut in the Startup Folder

1. **Navigate to the Startup Folder**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter. This will open the **Startup folder**.

2. **Create a Shortcut to the `.bat` File**:
   - **Do not move the `.bat` file** directly into this folder. Instead, you need to create a shortcut.
   - Right-click on your `.bat` file (e.g., `start-pm2.bat`) that you saved in the folder `D:\NoAccess-Backup(Shyam.M)\watcher`.
   - Select **Create shortcut**.
   - A shortcut will be created in the same folder.

3. **Move the Shortcut to the Startup Folder**:
   - Now, move (or copy) the **shortcut** (not the `.bat` file itself) into the **Startup folder** you opened earlier.
   
   This will make sure that when Windows starts, the batch script runs automatically.

### Verify and Test:

1. **Restart Your Computer**:
   - Restart your PC to test if the script runs automatically when the system boots up.

2. **Check PM2 Process**:
   - After your PC starts, open Command Prompt or PowerShell, and run:
     ```bash
     pm2 list
     ```
     This will show if your `bun --dev` process is running.

### Optional: Add Logging for Troubleshooting
If you want to make sure the script is running properly, you can add a log to the `.bat` file to capture any errors or output.

Modify the `.bat` file to include logging like this:

```batch
@echo off
cd /d "D:\NoAccess-Backup(Shyam.M)\watcher"
pm2 start bun --dev >> "D:\NoAccess-Backup(Shyam.M)\watcher\pm2-start-log.txt" 2>&1
```

This will create a `pm2-start-log.txt` file in your `watcher` directory, where you can see the output of the `pm2` command (including errors).

---

### In Summary:
- Make sure you're placing the **shortcut** to the `.bat` file in the Startup folder, not the `.bat` file itself.
- After adding the shortcut, restart your computer to check if the batch file runs automatically.
- Optionally, add logging to check for errors or output.
