The two Docker Compose configurations you provided have several differences:

### 1. **Services Included**
- **First Configuration:** 
  - Only includes `database` and `stub-idp` services.
  
- **Second Configuration:** 
  - Adds an `app` service and a `reverse-proxy` service.

### 2. **Service Dependencies**
- **First Configuration:** 
  - No dependencies specified.

- **Second Configuration:** 
  - The `app` service depends on both the `database` and `stub-idp`.
  - The `reverse-proxy` service depends on the `app`.

### 3. **Ports Exposed**
- **First Configuration:** 
  - `stub-idp` exposes port `5003:8080`.

- **Second Configuration:** 
  - `stub-idp` does not specify a port mapping, and `reverse-proxy` exposes port `5010:5010`.

### 4. **Environment Variables**
- **First Configuration:** 
  - The `stub-idp` service uses `https://localhost:5001` for the `SIMPLESAMLPHP_SP_ENTITY_ID` and `SIMPLESAMLPHP_SP_ASSERTION_CONSUMER_SERVICE`.

- **Second Configuration:** 
  - The `stub-idp` service uses `http://localhost:5010` for these variables, which suggests a change in endpoint handling.

### 5. **Restart Policy**
- **First Configuration:** 
  - No restart policy is defined.

- **Second Configuration:** 
  - The `database` service has a `restart: always` policy, ensuring it restarts if it fails.

### Summary
The second configuration is more complex, incorporating additional services, dependencies, and a restart policy for the database. It also changes the port mappings and service endpoint URLs.

To keep the container alive for shell access, you can add a command like `tail -f /dev/null` at the end of your Dockerfile. Here's how you can modify the `ENTRYPOINT` to include this:

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0 AS build-env
WORKDIR /app

COPY EyeOrderCore.csproj ./ 
RUN dotnet restore

# Copy everything else and build
COPY ./ ./ 
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out

# Build runtime image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-env /app/out .

# Set the entry point
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "EyeOrderCore.dll"]

# Keep the container alive
CMD ["tail", "-f", "/dev/null"]
```

### Explanation:
- **ENTRYPOINT:** This is still set to run your application.
- **CMD:** This will keep the container running by executing `tail -f /dev/null`, allowing you to access the shell if needed. 

Note that the `CMD` will only take effect if the `ENTRYPOINT` does not receive any command-line arguments. If you want to run the application and keep the container alive, you may want to modify the way you run the container, depending on your needs.

To access the shell of a running Docker container, you can follow these steps like a pro:

### Step 1: List Running Containers
First, you need to find the ID or name of the running container. Use the following command:

```bash
docker ps
```

This will display a list of all running containers. Look for your container in the list.

### Step 2: Access the Container's Shell
Once you have the container ID or name, you can use the `docker exec` command to start a shell session inside the container. Replace `<container_id_or_name>` with your actual container ID or name:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/sh
```

### Explanation:
- `docker exec`: This command allows you to run commands in a running container.
- `-it`: This flag combines two options:
  - `-i` keeps STDIN open even if not attached.
  - `-t` allocates a pseudo-TTY, giving you an interactive shell.
- `/bin/sh`: This specifies the shell you want to use. If your container has `bash`, you can use `/bin/bash` instead.

### Example:
If your container ID is `abc123`, you would run:

```bash
docker exec -it abc123 /bin/sh
```

### Step 3: Working Inside the Container
Once you're inside, you can run any commands as if you were in a normal shell. You can check files, install packages, or troubleshoot as needed.

### Step 4: Exit the Shell
To exit the shell session, simply type:

```bash
exit
```

And you're back to your host machine's terminal.

### Note:
If your container doesn't have a shell (like `sh` or `bash`), you might need to adjust the command accordingly. You can check the base image documentation to know which shell is available.






psql -U dev -d eye-order-2


To interact with the PostgreSQL database running in your container and see the databases, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Access the PostgreSQL Shell
First, ensure you’re inside the PostgreSQL container’s shell. If you’re not already there, use the following command to enter the container:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_id_or_name> /bin/bash
```

### Step 2: Connect to PostgreSQL
Once inside the container, you can access the PostgreSQL interactive terminal (`psql`). Use the following command, substituting `dev` for your PostgreSQL username and `secret` for your password (as specified in your `docker-compose` file):

```bash
psql -U dev -d eye-order-2
```

### Step 3: List Databases
Once you're in the `psql` shell, you can list all databases with the following command:

```sql
\l
```

### Step 4: Switch Databases
If you want to switch to a different database (for example, `eye-order-2`), you can use:

```sql
\c eye-order-2
```

### Step 5: View Tables
To see the tables in the current database, use:

```sql
\dt
```

### Step 6: Query Data
You can run SQL queries to view data from specific tables. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM your_table_name;
```

### Step 7: Exit the PostgreSQL Shell
To exit the `psql` shell, type:

```sql
\q
```

### Summary
1. Access the container shell.
2. Use `psql` to connect to your database.
3. Use `\l` to list databases, `\c` to switch databases, and `\dt` to list tables.

If you have any specific tasks or queries in mind, feel free to ask!
