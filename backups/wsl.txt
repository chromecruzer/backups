To check if **Ubuntu** (or any other Linux distribution) is successfully installed and running under **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**, follow these steps:

### 1. **Check Installed Distributions**
First, you need to confirm that **Ubuntu** is installed and available on your system.

1. **Open PowerShell or Command Prompt** as **Administrator**.
2. Run the following command to list all installed WSL distributions:

   ```powershell
   wsl --list --verbose
   ```

   This will show you all the distributions you have installed along with their **version** (WSL 1 or WSL 2) and their current status (whether they are running or stopped).

   Example output:

   ```
   NAME            STATE           VERSION
   * Ubuntu-20.04   Running         2
   ```

   If **Ubuntu** is listed and its **state** is **Running** or **Stopped**, it is successfully installed. If it's not listed, the installation may not have completed successfully.

### 2. **Check if Ubuntu is Running**
If you want to check if **Ubuntu** is running, you can do one of the following:

- **Check Running Distributions**:
  Run the following command to list only the distributions that are currently running:

  ```powershell
  wsl --list --running
  ```

  If **Ubuntu** is listed here, it's actively running. If it isn't listed, it may be stopped.

- **Check Using the Task Manager**:
  You can also check if Ubuntu is running by checking the processes in the **Task Manager**:
  - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open **Task Manager**.
  - Look under the **Processes** tab for a process named something like `vmmem` or `wslhost`, which indicates that a WSL instance is running.

### 3. **Start Ubuntu (if itâ€™s not running)**
If **Ubuntu** is not running, you can start it by simply opening it from the **Start Menu** or by running the following command in PowerShell:

```powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
```

This will launch the default shell for Ubuntu in your WSL environment. If **Ubuntu** is correctly installed, you should see a Linux terminal prompt.

### 4. **Check the Version of Ubuntu Running**
If Ubuntu is installed and running, you can check the exact version of the Ubuntu distribution you're using by running the following command inside the Ubuntu terminal:

```bash
lsb_release -a
```

This will show you details about the Ubuntu version, such as the release number and codename (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, etc.).

### 5. **Check WSL Version (Optional)**
To check if you are using **WSL 1** or **WSL 2** (the default is WSL 2), you can run:

```powershell
wsl --list --verbose
```

This will display the **version** of each installed distribution (either 1 or 2).

For example:
```
NAME            STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu-20.04   Running         2
```

If the **version** is **2**, that means you're running WSL 2, which is recommended for better performance and support for running Linux GUI apps.

### 6. **Confirm Ubuntu Installation via Shell**
You can also run the following in PowerShell to confirm the installation:

```powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu -- bash -c "echo 'Ubuntu is running!'"
```

If you see the output `Ubuntu is running!`, then Ubuntu is successfully installed and running.
