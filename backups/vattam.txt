EO2 Cypress Unit Testing Kit 

To run Cypress tests, you need to ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed first. Since you're inside the `EyeOrderCore.UiTests` folder, you can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (if not already done)
Ensure you have all the dependencies installed, including Cypress. Since you have a `package.json` file and a `yarn.lock` file, it suggests you're using **Yarn** as your package manager. Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will install all dependencies defined in your `package.json` and `yarn.lock`.

### Step 2: Run Cypress Tests
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run Cypress using the following command:

```bash
yarn cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner in interactive mode where you can select and run tests manually.

Alternatively, you can run Cypress in headless mode (without opening the Test Runner) by using this command:

```bash
yarn cypress run
```

### Step 3: Check Cypress Configuration (optional)
If you want to make sure Cypress is properly configured, you can check the `cypress.json` file in your project directory. This file contains configurations like the base URL, viewport size, and other settings related to running Cypress tests.

Yes, that's basically it! Once you've run the `yarn install` to install dependencies, running Cypress tests can be as simple as using:

- `yarn cypress open` to launch the Cypress Test Runner in interactive mode.
- `yarn cypress run` to run all the tests in headless mode (ideal for CI/CD environments).

However, here are a few additional tips in case you need more details:

### Additional Tips:

1. **Verify Cypress Installation**:
   If you're unsure whether Cypress was installed properly, you can check by running:
   ```bash
   yarn cypress --version
   ```
   This will show the installed version of Cypress.

2. **Run Specific Tests**:
   If you want to run a specific test or set of tests, you can use the `--spec` option like so:
   ```bash
   yarn cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/path/to/test.spec.js'
   ```
   Replace `'cypress/integration/path/to/test.spec.js'` with the actual path to your test file.

3. **Running with Environment Variables**:
   You can pass environment variables when running Cypress tests. For example:
   ```bash
   yarn cypress run --env configFile=staging
   ```
   You can define and use custom environment variables within your test scripts.

4. **Running Tests with Browsers**:
   By default, Cypress runs in Electron browser. However, you can specify a different browser like Chrome:
   ```bash
   yarn cypress run --browser chrome
   ```
   Or to see a list of supported browsers:
   ```bash
   yarn cypress open
   ```
   This will show a GUI that lets you select the browser to use.

5. **Debugging**:
   Cypress provides powerful debugging features. You can use `debug` logs to track down issues during test execution. You can also run Cypress in "headed" mode (interactive mode) to see exactly what's happening during your test runs.
